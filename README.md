# Super's Character Collection
This is a repository of script JSONs for my homebrew character collection. **[See the Bloodstar almanac here.](https://www.bloodstar.xyz/p/SuperGDPWYL/SCC_Released/almanac.html)**

## Initial Pretending
- *SCC Characters: **Veraxillus***
- *Difficulty: **Intermediate***

**Initial Pretending** is the homescript of the manipulative *Veraxillus*, who replicates the abilities of those they mimic. The Veraxillus has plenty of tools to "confirm" themselves between the Virgin, Pacifist and arguably Slayer, while they also have weapons in the form of the Philosopher, Puzzlemaster and Fool. Is that player actually confirmed, or are they just the Veraxillus?

*... or is there even a Veraxillus at all?* The Po and Yaggababble can both benefit from fearmongering on the potential of a sly Veraxillus to get the town to eliminate obstacles such as a Virgin for them, while preparing to kill multiple players in a surprise assault.


## Sunset of Bloodshed (incl. TBA, HBL & TBoTC characters)
- *SCC Characters: **Absolut**, **Hysteria**, **Conspiracist**, **Chemist***
- *Difficulty: **Advanced***

**Sunset of Bloodshed** is a rather tranquil script, as none of the Demons kill at night. The good team must try and work through the various obstacles in their info and gaps in their logic to find the Demon while on an unknown timer... until it all snaps. 

Once the Au'Wre has found their Minions, or when Hysteria breaks out, all players learn this is the final day. They now know for certain which Demon they're facing, but don't have much time to act on it. Players might make a lapse in their judgement on who to execute against Au'Wre, or may end up killing their own allies off against Hysteria...

and while some Demons warn of the final day, not all of them do. Against Absolut, good has absolut-ly no idea what they're facing and will have to make a guess off of that most info doesn't add up. However, some of it will... and good has to make sure evil doesn't identify this outlier.

## The Only Thing I Know For Real (incl. TBA, HBL & TBoTC characters)
- *SCC Characters: **Muras**, **Fluxicon**, **Cataclsym**, **Earthmover**, **Insurrectionist**, **Cryptographer***
- *Difficulty: **Intermediate***

**The Only Thing I Know For Real** is a script filled with glass cannons. The Demons excel at killing... and that's about it. The evil team will have little to no misinformation on their hands, and must kill their way through the good team before they can figure out who the Demon is. Thankfully, some of the Minions are equipped to kill or win: the Harpy forces good players to accuse each other or die, the Earthmover condemns players to a telegraphed but unavoidable death, the Crawler wins if they can engineer 2 executions and the Goblin wins if they're executed.

On the other hand, not every good character can sit around and get info; they're going to have to earn it. The Cryptographer learns who the Demon is outright, but must find a nebulous anomaly to do it. The Insurrectionist can create a long chain of confirmation, but can't let evil find it. The Seraph can confirm themselves and another good player, but they have to nominate & execute them first. The Courier can get anything, but will have to complete tasks to earn it. While confirmation is abundant, it can be compromised by a sly Huli Jing, so good will have to second-guess who's really confirmed in order to find the Demon.
