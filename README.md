# Super's Character Collection
This is a repository of script JSONs for my homebrew character collection. **[See the Bloodstar almanac here.](https://www.bloodstar.xyz/p/SuperGDPWYL/SCC_Released/almanac.html)**

## Initial Pretending
- *SCC Characters: **Veraxillus***
- *Difficulty: **Intermediate***

**Initial Pretending** is the homescript of the manipulative *Veraxillus*, who replicates the abilities of those they mimic. The Veraxillus has plenty of tools to "confirm" themselves between the Virgin, Pacifist and arguably Slayer, while they also have weapons in the form of the Philosopher, Puzzlemaster and Fool. Is that player actually confirmed, or are they just the Veraxillus?

*... or is there even a Veraxillus at all?* The Po and Yaggababble can both benefit from fearmongering on the potential of a sly Veraxillus to get the town to eliminate obstacles such as a Virgin for them, while preparing to kill multiple players in a surprise assault.


## Sunset of Bloodshed (incl. TBA, HBL & TBoTC characters)
- *SCC Characters: **Absolut**, **Hysteria**, **Conspiracist**, **Chemist***
- *Difficulty: **Advanced***

**Sunset of Bloodshed** is a rather tranquil script, as none of the Demons kill at night. The good team must try and work through the various obstacles in their info and gaps in their logic to find the Demon while on an unknown timer... until it all snaps. 

Once the Au'Wre has found their Minions, or when Hysteria breaks out, all players learn this is the final day. They now know for certain which Demon they're facing, but don't have much time to act on it. Players might make a lapse in their judgement on who to execute against Au'Wre, or may end up killing their own allies off against Hysteria...

and while some Demons warn of the final day, not all of them do. Against Absolut, good has absolut-ly no idea what they're facing and will have to make a guess off of that most info doesn't add up. However, some of it will... and good has to make sure evil doesn't identify this outlier.
